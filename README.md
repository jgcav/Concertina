# Concertina

Concertina is designed to be a simple web application for sharing information about concerts I have been to.

On this project, I exclusively used tech I had never worked with before. I built a simple app using the knowledge and skills I was able to gain over the course of a few days, and over time I would like to expand on this project and implement other features such as filtering.
